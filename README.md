# Paper_GRL_phase_locked_circumglobal_heat_extremes

Scripts used to reproduce the main figures in the paper "Heat Extremes Driven by Amplification of Phase-Locked Circumglobal Waves Forced by Topography in an Idealized Atmospheric Model" by B. Jim√©nez-Esteve, K. Kornhuber and D. I.V. Domeisen published in Geophysical Research Letters.

The ICON model data can be downloaded from the following zenodo link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7270361

The dowloadable data contains:
  - The computed 7-day averaged v300 wave amplitudes for each model simulation
  - The daily mean fields of u300, v300, z300, t1000 (only northern hemisphere) for each model simulation.
  - The daily heatwave occurence (binary data 0=no heatwave, 1=heatwave) for each grid point and model simulation.
